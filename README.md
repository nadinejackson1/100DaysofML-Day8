# Text Preprocessing Pipeline

This repository contains a basic text preprocessing pipeline, which includes tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal. These steps are essential in many natural language processing tasks, and my goal is to provide a simple, easy-to-use tool for these purposes.

### Getting Started

Define the preprocess function, which takes in a string of text and returns the preprocessed text as a list of stemmed tokens with stopwords removed:

    def preprocess(text):
        # Convert the text to lowercase
        text = text.lower()

        # Tokenize the text into individual words
        words = word_tokenize(text)

        # Remove the stopwords
        words = [word for word in words if word not in stopwords.words('english')]

        # Apply stemming to the words
        stemmer = PorterStemmer()
        words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]

        return words

### Usage

To use the text preprocessing pipeline in your Colab notebook, simply call the preprocess function and pass in your text as a string:

    text = "I love machine learning and natural language processing!"
    processed_text = preprocess(text)
    print(processed_text)

This will output the preprocessed text as a list of stemmed tokens with stopwords removed:

    ['love', 'machin', 'learn', 'natur', 'languag', 'process']
